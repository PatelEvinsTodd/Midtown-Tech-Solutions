Midtown Tech Solutions Site
===========================
Website source for the Midtown Tech Solutions partnership based in Memphis, TN.

Installation
------------
MTS site runs on the Django web framework for Python. This library and others can be installed with pip. You can install pip itself [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html).

It is strongly recommended to create a [virtual environment](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html) to house the required libraries.

To install the required libraries, run this command at the top-level directory:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

To start a local development server, run this command in the `mts` directory:

`$ python manage.py runserver`

Go to localhost:8000 in your favorite web browser to view. Now get developing!
